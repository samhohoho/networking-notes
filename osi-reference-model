OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) Model
  - A standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
  - Standardize how computers communicate with one another over a network.
  - Seven-layered approach to data transmission.
    Operations are divided at each layer.
  - A layer serves the layer above.
  - To break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble.

The Upper OSI Layers
  - Includes the Message Body and Subject Line in an email message for example.

7. Application
  - Provide network services to the app.
  - To interact with data from the user.
  - Clients rely on this layer to initiate communication.
  - Clients are not part of the layer.
  - Synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity.
    Data integrity: check data is not altered or corrupted in transit.
  - Responsible for the protocols and data manipulation.
    For client to present meaningful data to the user.
  - Protocols include HTTP and SMTP (email communication).

6. Presentation
  - Prepare data for the Application layer.
  - Make data presentable for apps to consume.
  - Responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.
  - Add encryption on sender's end and decode encryption on receiver's end.
  - Compress data from Application layer before layer 5.
    minimize data amount to improve speed and efficiency.

5. Session
  - Establishes, manages, and terminates communication session.
  - session = the time between the communication is opened and closed.
  - Responsible for opening and closing communication between the 2 devices.
  - Ensure the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged.
    Then close to avoid wasting resources.
  - Synchronize data transfer with checkpoints.
    If crashed at 52mb, session will be resumed at 50mb.

4. Transport
  - To segment, transfer, and reassemble.
  - Break up data from Session layer into chunks (segments) before layer 3.
    To prevent transmission problem.
  - Reassemble the segments for Session layer.
  - Responsible for flow control and error control in inter-network communications.
    And error recovery.
  - Flow control
    - optimal speed of transmission.
    - ensure fast sender doesnt overwhelm the slow connection receiver.
  - Error control
    - Ensure complete data received on receiver's end.
    - request retransmission if not.
  - Check traffic's target server by checking the port number.
  - Ultilize source and destination port numbers to track session.
    Sender DST: 80 SRC: 1500
    Receiver DST: 1500 SRC: 80
  - Protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
    Port number (80 -> HTTP web traffic, 25 -> email)
  - TCP -> reliable, UDP -> speed (voice or video traffic)

3. Network
  - Includes the source and IP address.
  - Provide connectivity, logical address (IP address), and path selection.
  - Facilitate data transfer between two networks.
  - Break up segments from Transport layer into smaller units (Packets).
  - Reassemble on receiver's end.
  - Routing
    - Finds the best physical path to destination.
  - Protocols include IP, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IGMP (Internet Group Message Protocol), and IPsec suite.
  - Check IP address.
  - Includes
    - Routers

2. The data link
  - Similar to Network layer.
  - Facilitate data transfer between 2 devices on the same networks.
  - Break up Packets into smaller pieces (Frames).
  - Responsible for Flow Control and Error Control in intra-network communication.
  - Check MAC address, discard packets if mismatch.
  - Includes 
    - MAC address if sending over an Ethernet network.
    - Switches.

1. Physical
  - Defines needed specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link.
    Like voltage level, data rate, max transmission distances, physical connectors.
  - Includes physical equipment involved in data transfer.
    Cables and switches.
  - Convert data into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s.
  - Includes
    - Hub
