OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) Model
  - A standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
  - Standardize how computers communicate with one another over a network.
  - Seven-layered approach to data transmission.
    Operations are divided at each layer.
  - A layer serves the layer above.
  - To break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble.

7. Application
  - To interact with data from the user.
  - Clients rely on this layer to initiate communication.
  - Clients are not part of the layer.
  - Responsible for the protocols and data manipulation.
    For client to present meaningful data to the user.
  - Protocols include HTTP and SMTP (email communication).

6. Presentation
  - Prepare data for the Application layer.
  - Make data presentable for apps to consume.
  - Responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.
  - Add encryption on sender's end and decode encryption on receiver's end.
  - Compress data from Application layer before layer 5.
    minimize data amount to improve speed and efficiency.

5. Session
  - session = the time between the communication is opened and closed.
  - Responsible for opening and closing communication between the 2 devices.
  - Ensure the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged.
    Then close to avoid wasting resources.
  - Synchronize data transfer with checkpoints.
    If crashed at 52mb, session will be resumed at 50mb.
