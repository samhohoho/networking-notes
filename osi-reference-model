Encapsulation
  Process of enclosing data within a protocol header as it travels through the network layers.
  To add info and control parameters to data for proper transmission and delivery to dst.
  The header contains control info
    Source and dst addresses, sequence numbers, error detection codes, and protocol-specific parameters.

DNS domain name system
  Maintains a mapping of FQDNs to IP addresses.

ARP address resolution protocol
  Map the IP address to MAC address.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) Model
  - A standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
  - Standardize how computers communicate with one another over a network.
  - Seven-layered approach to data transmission.
    Operations are divided at each layer.
  - A layer serves the layer above.
  - To break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble.

The Upper OSI Layers
  - Includes the Message Body and Subject Line in an email message for example.

7. Application
  - Provide network services to the app.
  - To interact with data from the user.
  - Clients rely on this layer to initiate communication.
  - Clients are not part of the layer.
  - Synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity.
    Data integrity: check data is not altered or corrupted in transit.
  - Responsible for the protocols and data manipulation.
    For client to present meaningful data to the user.
  - Protocols include HTTP and SMTP (email communication).

6. Presentation
  - Prepare data for the Application layer.
  - Make data presentable for apps to consume.
  - Responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.
  - Add encryption on sender's end and decode encryption on receiver's end.
  - Compress data from Application layer before layer 5.
    minimize data amount to improve speed and efficiency.

5. Session
  - Establishes, manages, and terminates communication session.
  - session = the time between the communication is opened and closed.
  - Responsible for opening and closing communication between the 2 devices.
  - Ensure the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged.
    Then close to avoid wasting resources.
  - Introduce synchronization points
    If crashed at 52mb, session will be resumed at 50mb.
  - relies lower layers to handle data integrity and reliability.

4. Transport
  - To segment, transfer, and reassemble.
  - Break up data from Session layer into chunks (segments) before layer 3.
    To prevent transmission problem.
  - Reassemble the segments for Session layer.
  - Responsible for flow control and error control in inter-network communications.
    And error recovery.
  - Flow control
    - optimal speed of transmission.
    - ensure fast sender doesnt overwhelm the slow connection receiver.
  - Error control
    - Ensure complete data received on receiver's end.
    - request retransmission if not.
  - Check traffic's target server by checking the port number.
  - Ultilize source and destination port numbers to establish connection and track session.
    Sender DST: 80 SRC: 1500
    Receiver DST: 1500 SRC: 80
  - Protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
    Port number (80 -> HTTP web traffic, 25 -> email)
  - Source IP address + source port = sender unique id
  - TCP -> reliable, UDP -> speed (voice or video traffic)

3. Network
  - Quality of Service
    - different level of service based on traffic requirements.
    - manage network resources
    - bandwidth management, prioritization, traffic shaping and policy, delay and latency management, 
  - Includes the source and IP address.
  - Provide connectivity, logical address (IP address), and path selection.
  - Facilitate data transfer between two networks.
  - Break up segments from Transport layer into smaller units (Packets).
  - Reassemble on receiver's end.
  - Routing
    - Finds the best physical path to destination.
  - Protocols include IP, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IGMP (Internet Group Message Protocol), and IPsec suite.
  - Check IP address.
  - Includes
    - Routers

2. The data link
  - the Ethernet medium on LAN
  - Ethernet header
    - preamble: synchronize
    - dst address
    - src address
    - length/ethertype
    - data
    - FCS frame check sequence: integrity check
  - Similar to Network layer.
  - Facilitate data transfer between 2 devices on the same networks.
  - Break up Packets into smaller pieces (Frames).
  - Responsible for Flow Control and Error Control in intra-network communication.
  - Check MAC address, discard packets if mismatch.
  - frames are encoded and decoded
  - provides error detection and correction for Physical layer.
  - Includes 
    - MAC address if sending over an Ethernet network.
    - Switches.

1. Physical
  - Defines needed specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link.
    Like voltage level, data rate, max transmission distances, physical connectors.
  - Includes physical equipment involved in data transfer.
    Cables and switches.
  - Convert data into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s.
  - conveys the bit stream, electrical impulse, light or radio signals
    through the network at the electrical and mechanical level.
  - Includes
    - Hub

Ethernet Connection Media
  - for connecting devices in a LAN
  - physical medium
    - copper-based twisted-pair cables (computer to switches)
    - fibre optic
  - newer CAT has higher bandwidth connections
  - straight-through cables for end device to switch
  - crossover cables for same devices
  - modern switches support Auto MDI-X
  - connector type is RJ-45; max-length 100m; plug to switch
  - fibre cables
    - longer distance
    - higher bandwidth requirements
    - plug to transceiver then switch
  - PoE (power over ethernet) switch:
    - power connected devices

Media Access Control MAC address
  - ethernet uses 48bit (6 bytes * 8 bits) hexadecimal MAC address
  - 1st 24 bits: OUI organizationally unique identifier
    - identifies manufacturer of ethernet port
    - assigned by IEEE
  - last 24 bits: vendor assigned
  - addresses number: 2^48
  no logical addressing, just address space
