host
  - any device, server, web browser, or computer that is connected to a network.
  - each identified by unique IP address
Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A network that connects devices which are in the same local area (like Uni campus).

Wide Area Network 
  - To have connectivity between Office 1 and Office 2.
  - Dedicated server between routers.
  - To have connectivity between different end hosts on the network.

Switch 
  - To allow connectivity on my Local Area Network.
Router
  - To route traffic between different areas of your network.
  - link different subnets and route traffic between them.
Firewall
  - Between Router and Internet.

For end hosts (PC, server, and printer) to talk to each other, need to ethernet cable these devices to the network Switch.

For a laptop to connect to wireless network, a Wireless Access Point (WAP) to connect into the Switch.

For a laptop to talk to devices out on the internet, connect Switch to Router.

Cost
Security
  - Firewall and security features on router, switches, and other devices.
  - Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
Availability
  - Always stays up.
  - Have backup components if one failed.
Scalability
  - Network to grow with company without redesign.
Reliability
  - Similar to availability.
  - network is reliable and continue to work.

Production Network
  - In band
  - The cables normal users would use.

Network Interface, aka NIC (network interface card)
  Hardware component that allows device to connect and communicate with a network.
  Data transmission and reception.
  Resides on motherboard or expansion card.
  Connects to network medium, like Ethernet cables/wireless signals.
  Provide hardware and software for communication.
  Has unique MAC address.
  Converts digital data into electrical signals or radio waves.
  Encapsulates data into frames/packets.
  Adds headers.
  Manages data flow based on network protocols.
  Network configuration.
    IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers.


ARP address resolution protocol
  Maps IP address to MAC address.
  Mainly IPv4 and local networks.
  If different IP subnet,
    ARP request for its default gateway.
  To check cache in linux:
    arp -n: view ARP cache.
    ip -s -s neigh flush all: clear cache.
  Process:
    ARP request.
      Device checks ARP cache (table that stores ARP mappings).
      If not found, broadcast message and asking "who the fuck has this IP address)
    ARP reply
      Include its MAC address.
      The requesting device to update its ARP cache.
    ARP caching
    ARP resolution
      The sending device encapsulate data into ethernet frame, including MAC address.
      The receiving device uses MAC address to deliver to the correct network interface.
