router DNS commands
  to config router to resolve FQDNs itself

show running-config | include ip domain-name
  view configured domain name

To make router as DNS client:
Often we only work with IP addresses
	ip domain-lookup
    enable DNS resolution on router for hostnam-to-IP address translation.
    when enabled, ping example.com.
    resolve example.com using DNS first, command second.
    error message if DNS resolution failed.
	ip name-server 172.23.4.1 (primary domain name)
    configure DNS server IP addresses
	ip domain-name flackboxA.lab (additional DNS suffix to search)
    configure the default domain name for the device.
    When ip domain-lookup enabled,
      it will append the default domain name to the hostname.
      ping router1 -> resolve router1.example.com
  copy running-config startup-config
    save the config to the router's startup config
  test with ping or nslookup followed by a hostname.

To make router as DNS server:
After the DNS client commands.
  ip dns server
    configure it as a DNS server
  ip host LinuxA 172.23.4.2
    address records to be resolved

show arp: view ARP cache
clear arp-cache: clear ARP cache
