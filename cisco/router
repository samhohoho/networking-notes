Commands:
  sh ip int brief

Configures IP address on router interfaces
  Commands
    config t
    interface FastEthernet0/0
    ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
    no shut
    end

Main functions
  Determine best path to available networks.
  Forwarding traffic

Routing table
  Store best available paths to a destination network.
  Consists of 
    Directly connected networks
    Statically configured routes or dynamically learned thru protocol.

Connected routes
  When network interface device active &&
  has IP address
    Automatically created in routing table.
    Based on network address and subnet mask of connected interface.
  Indicates device is connected to specified network.
  Example:
    Router has interface 192.168.1.1/24
    Automatically add connected route to 192.168.1.0/24 network in table.
    If any traffic for 192.168.1.0/24 network is received on another interface,
      it will forward to the proper network.
  Commands:
    sh ip route - view routing table
    
Local routes
  From IOS 15
  To show actual IP address on interface.

Static routes
  Has to be reachable on directly connected interfaces.
  Commands:
    ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2

Longest prefix match
  Determine best matching route.
  Match the dst IP address with most specific prefix in routing table.
  "longest" refers to network prefix with highest number of matching bits.

Default route
  AKA default gateway / default gateway route.
  To forward network traffic when no specific match for dst IP address.
    Indicating matches any IP address (0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).
    Becuz subnet mask is all zero.
  The last resort or fallback option.
  Example:
    ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
