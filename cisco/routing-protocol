Introduction
  Types:
    IGP Interior gateway protocols
      For within an organization.
    EGP Exterior gateway protocols
      Between organizations over internet.
      Only used today is BGP Border Gateway Protocol.
  Determine best path for data packets to destination.
  Employ algorithms and metrics to make routing decision.
  Based on network congestion, link reliability, and administrative preferences.
  Automatically update when subneet is removed.

RIP Routing information protocol
  Oldest.
  Commands:
    debug ip rip

Interior gateway protocols
  Only share info with neighbours.
  Distance vector routing protocols
    Routing by rumour.
    Uses hop count as metric.
    Exchanges routing table between routers at regular interval.
  Link state routing protocols
    Operates within an AS Autonomous system.
    Uses SPF Shortest path first algorithm
      to calculate best path based on cost.
    Routers exchange LSA link-state advertisements
      to build and maintain topology database.
      allow each router to have complete network map.
