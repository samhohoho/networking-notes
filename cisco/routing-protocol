Introduction
  Types:
    IGP Interior gateway protocols
      For within an organization.
    EGP Exterior gateway protocols
      Between organizations over internet.
      Only used today is BGP Border Gateway Protocol.
  Determine best path for data packets to destination.
  Employ algorithms and metrics to make routing decision.
  Based on network congestion, link reliability, and administrative preferences.
  Automatically update when subneet is removed.
  Commands:
    sh run | section rip
    sh run | begin rip

Metric
  Lowest metric value is preferred.

Flow
  A sequence of packets share common characteristics.
  Identified by packet header attributes:
    Src & dst IP addresses/ports or protocol types.

Interior gateway protocols
  Only share info with neighbours.
  Distance vector routing protocols
  Link state routing protocols
    Each router maintains detailed database of network's topology.
    Database contains all routers, links, and networks.
    Each router floods LSAs Link-state advertisements to neighbour routers.

RIP Routing information protocol
  Distance-vector routing.
  Oldest.
  Uses hop count as metric.
  Max hop count by default is 15.
  Exchanges routing table between routers at regular interval.
  Updates stop when convergence is reached.
    All routers have consistent routing information.
  If a link/network fails,
    RIP routes mark affected routes as invalid.
    Then notify neighbours.
  Routing by rumour.
  Used in small env.
  Commands:
    debug ip rip

***only for CCNA***
RIPv2 
  Multicast address 224.0.0.9
  Authentication, and password.
    Adjacency with matching password.
  Classless routing.
    Subnet info with network address.
    Finer-grained routing decisions.
  VLSM and CIDR
    Network with different subnet mask lengths.
  Automatic summarize routes to classful boundary.
    Undesireable, could cause havoc on network.
    Blackholing, dropping traffic.
  Network command reference classful network, no subnet mask.
    10.0.0.0 not 10.1.1.0 
  Commands:
    router rip
    version 2
    network 10.0.0.0

    no auto-summary
  All 10. network send hello message.
  Manual summarization
    10.0.0.0/16 -> 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24
    Commands:
      interface f1/0
      ip summary-address rip 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0
      show ip protocols


OSPF Open Shortest path first
  Link-state routing protocol.
  Operates within an AS Autonomous system.
  Uses SPF Shortest path first algorithm
    to calculate best path based on cost.
  Uses cost as metric.
    Cost refers to overall efficiency to send packets.
    Higher bandwidth will have lower cost.
  Routers exchange LSA link-state advertisements
    to build and maintain topology database.
    allow each router to have complete network map.

IS-IS Intermediate system to Intermediate system
  Link-state routing protocol.
  Common in large service provider networks.
  Operates at OSI layer 2.
  Uses SPF algorithm and LSPs link-state packets
    Build and maintain a network topology.
  Uses administrative distance metric to best path.
    Default by hop counts, unless costs on links configured.
    Based on link bandwidth, reliability, and administrative preferences.
  If required path manipulation,
    configure cost of links.

EIGRP Enhanced interior gateway routing protocol
  Metric based on bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load.
    Load and reliability are ignored by default.
  Path manipulation:
    Configure delay on links.
  Only supports cisco router.
  Large network, fast convergence time.
  Multicast.
  4 equal cost load balancing - default
  UnEqual cost load balancing.
    Needs manual config.
  AS - independent administered domain.
  Requires same AS number to peer.
  Wildcard mask - subnet mask inverse 
    Subtract each octet in subnet mask from 255.
    0.255.255.255 - default
  Not advertised:
    Not in range.
    Not configured on any interface.
  Commands:
    router eigrp 100
    network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 
      Interface in 10.0. range.
  Identify using router ID, IPv4 address.
    Default loopback address then highest address.
    Commands:
      show ip protocols

ECMP Equal cost multi-path
  Routing techniques that allows traffic distribution across same cost/metric paths.
  Equal cost paths = paths with same metric.
  Achieve load balancing.
    Flow-based:
      Packets belong to same flow.
      To maintain packets order.
    Packet-based:
      Different packets of same flow to diffrent paths.
  All IGP routing protocols perform ECMP by default.
  EIGRP can UnEqual cost multi-path.
    Must Configure.

Administrative distance
  Determine trustworthiness/reliability of a routing protocol/source.
    When multiple routing protocols provide info about same destination.
  Lower administrative distance value indicates higher priority.
  Default:
		Connected interface: 0
		Static route: 1
		Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP): 90
		Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): 110
		Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): 20
    IS-IS: 115
    RIP: 120
  Allows dynamic adjustments in routing table.
  CLI:
    R   10.1.1.0/24 [120/1] via 10.0.0.2
      120/1 = AD/metric

Floating static routes
  Backup/secondary route in case primary route invalid.
  By assigning higher AD to backup static route.
  Primary route can be:
    Dynamic route learned from routing protocol.
    Static route explicitly configured.
  Backup route for OSPF
    Commands:
      ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.3.2 115

Loopback interface
  Loopback address/virtual interface, logical interface on network device.
  Software-based interface in device's OS.
  Not associated with physical hardware.
  Created by OS to provide network connectivity within device.
  Just like regular network interface,
    but traffics processed internally.
  Identified by loopback address, IP address.
    127.0.0.0/8 - range
    127.0.0.1 - common loopback/localhost address
  Allow app/service run on device to communicate internally.
  Internal testing and troubleshooting network services and apps.
  Network management.
    SNMP simple network management protocol.
    Voice over IP, BGP peering etc.
  Loopback address are used as router ID or OSPF router ID.
  Stable and unique identifier for device.
  Routing and redundancy.
  Commands:
    interface loopback 0
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.255
    do sh run | sec eigrp
    router eigrp 100
    network 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0

Adjacency
  Relationship between directly connected devices.
  Established to facilitate exhange of routing info.
  By exchanging hello packets.

Passive interface
  Configure loopback interface as passive interface - Best
  Does not routing protocol updates.
  Reduce network overhead and conserving bandwidth.
  Commands:
    router rip
    passive-interface fast3/0
    network 203.0.113.0

Default route injection
  FInal outbound router, connected to internet.
  Prevent default static route on all routers.
  Internal routers learn automatically.
  Inject into RIP.
  Commands:
    ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
    router rip
    default-information originate
