Hubs similar to switches
End hosts in LAN commmunicate through hub or switch.
Inter-switch links
  Switches connection with ethernet cables.

Hubs
  Half-duplex mode
    Hosts either send or receive, no simultaneously
  All hosts same collision domain
    one device transmit at a time
    if > 1, resend
    CSMA/CD Carrier-sense multiple access / collision detection
      detect collisions and resend
  broadcast commmunication
  shared bandwidth
  no packet filtering based on MAC address
  simply physical connection point for devices

Switches
  connects devices in LAN
  facilitate the efficient forwarding of data packets between devices
  either full-duplex or half-duplex
  hosts own dedicated collision domain
  no collision detection
  operates at layer 1 and 2
  MAC address learning
    add MAC address table upon received which maps MAC addresses to ports
  better performance security
  if received broadcast address or unknown unicast dst
    flood out all ports except receiver

Router
  layer 3
  determines most appropriate path
  send traffic from subnet to another
  doesnt forward broadcast traffic by default
  NAT network address translation
    devices share a single public IP address
  firewalling
    unauthorized access and malicious activities
  QoS quality of service
    prioritize specific network traffic type
