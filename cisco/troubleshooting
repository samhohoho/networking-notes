Connectivity troubleshooting methods
  ping
    checks connectivity.
    Send ICMP echo request packets to dst.
    Measure round-trip time RTT.
    Check reachability and network latency.
  traceroute
    Does ping, hop by hop, from src to dst.
    Indicate which router has problem.
    TTL Time to live
      Prevent route loop.
      Decrease by 1 on every hop.
      Send time exceeded message when packet dropped.
    A series of packets with increasing TTL values.
      10 hops = 10 TTL to reach dst.
    Cr-S-6 to abort.
  telnet
    To manage network infra devices.
    To check if a port is open.

DNS
  Commands:
    nslookup
    ping by FQDN

Extended ping
  More flexibility.
  Specify IP address.
  Packet size.
  Timeout value.
  Number of packets.

Past problems
  IP connectivity issue
    ping R3
      Unrecognized host or address, or protocol not running.
    ping 10.10.30.1
      Unreachable, success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
    traceroute 10.10.30.1
      R2 not working.
      Into R2.
      Ping to R3 failed.
    sh ip route
      To check routing table.
      No route to 10.10.30.0
    config t
    ip route 10.10.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1
      Enter a static route.
      10.10.20.1: R3 interface on subnet.

CDP Cisco Discovery Protocol
  Proprietary layer 2 protocol.
  For network discovery and management on Cisco devices.
  Allows devices to exchange info with directly connected Cisco devices.
  Enabled by default
  Runs on most Cisco networking equipment.
  CDP messages are sent every 60 seconds by default.
  LLDP link layer discovery protocol, similar protocol.
  Should detect duplex mismatch.
  Neighbour discovery
    Identify neighbouring device connected to their interfaces.
    Info like device type, model, capabilities, the interfaces.
  Topology Discovery
    Understanding network layout and connections.
  Device Monitoring
    Monitoring status of neighbouring devices.
      Availability and operational state.
  Network Troubleshooting
  Automatic config

Troubleshooting
  Switch# show interface
    Interface is reporting errors, either layer 1 or 2 issue.
    Check cable integrity.
    Check config matches.

Speed and Duplex mismatch
  Interface operate below its max speed.
  Both sides must be same, either auto or manually configured.
  Best practice is to manually configure ports.

Layer 4
  Commands:
    telnet

Layer 2 troubleshooting
  Common commands
		Switch (config)# cdp run
		Switch (config)# no cdp run
      Disable globally on device.
		Switch (config-if)# no cdp enable
      Disable at interface level.
		Switch# show cdp
		Switch# show cdp neighbours
		Switch# show cdp neighbours detail

    show arp
    show mac address-table

Layer 1 troubleshooting
  Common problems
    Interface is administratively shut down.
    Cable is disconnected.
    Broken connectors, wires or fibres.
    EMI Electro-Magnetic Interference sources.
      Such as motors or microwaves.
      Cause errors in transmission.
  Common commands
    show interface
    Switch# show ip interface brief
      administratively down - issue 'no shutdown'
      down/down - layer 1 issue, check interface is cabled, device's power.
      up/down - layer 2 issue, speed mismatch.
        show run to check config on both interfaces.
