ping 127.0.0.1 to test TCP/IP on local

IP address assignment
  - static addressing
  - dynamic addressing
    - uses protocol DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - to automatically assign

IPv4
  - 32bit address
  - octet 0 - 255
  - 

Class A
  - for networks with many hosts
  - 1st octet -> network portion
    rest -> host portion
  - 1st bit always 0
  - default subnet mask = /8
  - valid network address
    - 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0/8
  - reserved
    - 0.0.0.0/8 = 'this network' used by protocol 
    - 127.0.0.0/8 for loopback address
  - not valid host addresses
    - 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255

Class B
  - first 2 octets -> network portion
  - 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0

Class C
  - first 3 bits always 1 1 0
  - 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0

Class D
  - reserved for IP multicast addresses
  - first 4 bits first octet always 1 1 1 0
  - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
  - not to host and no default subnet mask

Reserved private address
  - can be assigned to host
  - not routable on public internet
  - class a 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - b 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - c 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
IPv6
  - 128bit address
  -
