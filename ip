exam
  - always use /30 instead of 31

The magic number method
  - network address goes up in multiples of (256 - 248)

ping 127.0.0.1 to test TCP/IP on local
The first and last addresses are typically reserved for network and broadcast addresses.
The address range for the network 192.168.0.0/24 is from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255.
  - the first 3 octets reserved for network and subnet portions
Not allowed to use all 0's and 1's for both network and host bits.

ip subnet-zero command on router
  - overrides limitation, enabled by default

IP address assignment
  - static addressing
  - dynamic addressing
    - uses protocol DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - to automatically assign

IPv4
  - 32bit address
  - octet 0 - 255
  - 

Class A
  - for networks with many hosts
  - 1st octet -> network portion
    rest -> host portion
  - 1st bit always 0
  - default subnet mask = /8
  - valid network address
    - 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0/8
  - reserved
    - 0.0.0.0/8 = 'this network' used by protocol 
    - 127.0.0.0/8 for loopback address
  - not valid host addresses
    - 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255

Class B
  - first 2 octets -> network portion
  - 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0

Class C
  - first 3 bits always 1 1 0
  - 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0

Class D
  - reserved for IP multicast addresses
  - first 4 bits first octet always 1 1 1 0
  - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
  - not to host and no default subnet mask

Class E
  - 1 1 1 1
  - 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

Reserved private address
  - can be assigned to host
  - not routable on public internet
  - class a 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - b 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - c 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
IPv6
  - 128bit address
  - 

CIDR Classless Inter-Domain Routing
  - rm fixed /8, /16, /24
    split or subnet into smaller networks
  - more flexible and efficient 
  - VLSM (Variable-length subnet mask)
    - no strict boundaries between address classes
  - address aggregation / route summarization
    - multiple small network blocks to large block
    - reduce routing table entries
    - improve routing efficiency
    - without:
      - many routing entries
      - increase overhead in routing table updates
    - allow routers to route traffic to the aggregated network via single entry
    - conserve IP address space
    - reduce globally unique network addresses required for routing

Subnetting
  - subnet / subnetwork
  - rather than separate networks, subnet a single range into smaller portions.
  - a portion of host bits is allocated for subnet ID
    remaining bits for host ID.
  - number of available subnets = 2^(host-bits - 2)
    network address + broadcast address cannot be assigned to host.
  - 200.15.10.6/31, .00000110/31
    - 200.15.10.6 to 200.15.10.7
    - 00000110 to 00000111
    - 2 possible hosts per network
    - 128 ranges IP addresses
  - 200.15.10.0/30
    - 200.15.10.5 to 200.15.10.6
    - 00000101 to 00000110
    - network .4, broadcast .7

Subnetting Class C network
  /31
    - supported on Cisco routers for point to point links
    - no need for a network or broadcast address

Subnetting design steps
  - start with largest segment
  - big enough subnet size for growth
  - spare subnets for growth
  - design for future
