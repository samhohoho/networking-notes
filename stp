STP Spanning tree protocol
  Brief:
  	Layer 2.
  	Prevents loop, broadcast storms.
  	Shuts down physically cabled interfaces.
  	Reduce available bandwidth.
  	Slow convergence time.
  	Enabled on all modern switches.
    No load balancing.

    Bridge priority 0 - 65535, 32768 default.
    Bridge ID = MAC + bridge priority 
    ---
  How:
    Switch roles
      Root bridge, central point of networking.
      Root bridge - lowest bridge priority value / MAC.
    BPDU Bridge protocol data units
      Switches exchange BPDU.
      Switch's identity, role, cost to root bridge.
    Path cost calculation
      Root port.
      Designated port = opposite of root port
      Each switch calculates cost of reaching the root bridge.
      Based on link speed.
    Blocking ports
      Spanning tree blocks one side of blocked link.
      Blocking state on ports that not part of spanning tree.
      Designated port side = switch with least cost to root/bridge ID.
