STP Spanning tree protocol
  Brief:
  	Layer 2.
  	Prevents loop, broadcast storms.
  	Shuts down physically cabled interfaces.
  	Reduce available bandwidth.
  	Slow convergence time.
  	Enabled on all modern switches.
    No load balancing.
    ---
    Bridge priority 0 - 65535, 32768 default.
    Bridge ID = MAC + bridge priority 
    ---
  How:
    Switch roles
      Root bridge, central point of networking.
      Root bridge - lowest bridge priority value / MAC.
    BPDU Bridge protocol data units
      Switches exchange BPDU.
      Switch's identity, role, cost to root bridge.
    Path cost calculation
      Root port.
      Designated port = opposite of root port
      Each switch calculates cost of reaching the root bridge.
      Based on link speed.
    Blocking ports
      Spanning tree blocks one side of blocked link.
      Blocking state on ports that not part of spanning tree.
      Designated port side = switch with least cost to root/bridge ID.
  Commands:
    Verify:
      show spanning-tree vlan 1
      show mac address-table

Root bridge election
  Brief:
    By setting bridge priority.
    Old switch suboptimal performance.
    DIfferent root bridge for different VLANs.
  Commands:
    spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary - set 24576 bridge priority
    spanning-tree vlan 1 root 24576
    spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary - 28672

Portfast
  Brief:
  BPDU guard
    Port shutdown when received.
    Best on ports connect to end hosts.
  Commands:
    int f0/10
    spanning-tree portfast
    spanning-tree portfast default
    ---
    no spanning-tree portfast - for ports connected to switch
    ---
    spanning-tree bpduguard enable
    spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default - global

Root guard
  Glossary:
    root-inconsistent state: blocking all traffic from that port.
    Superior BPDU: BPDU with lower bridge ID.
  Brief:
    Prevents unintended root bridge.
    Ensure no unauthorized switch take over root bridge role.
    Root guard enabled port into root-inconsistent state when received superior BPDU.
    Configured on ports that never be path to root bridge.
  Commands:
    Configuration:
      interface fa0/2
      spanning-tree guard root
