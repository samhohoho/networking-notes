VLAN
  Brief:
    Layer 2.
    VLAN on switches.
    Switches flood broadcast traffic raises performance and security concerns.
      Bypass security policy on router (blocking traffic between A and B).
      Affects performance by using bandwidth.
    Segment LAN into separate broadcast domains.
    1-1 relation between an IP subnet nad a VLAN.
    Traffics/hosts in same IP subnet should in same VLAN.
    Example: 

VLAN access port
  Brief:
    Configured on switch interfaces where end hosts are plugged in.
    One specific VLAN.
    All ports are VLAN 1 - default
  Commands:
    Create VLAN:
      vlan 10
      name Eng
    Configure switch ports as access port:
      interface FastEthernet0/1
      switchport mode access
      switch port access vlan 10
      ---
      interface range FastEthernet0/3 - 5
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan 10
    Basic:
      show vlan brief
      show interface fastEthernet0/1 switchport

Network Topology
  Brief:
    Access, distribution, and core layers.
    Traditional data center env - North-South traffic flow.
    Modern - West-East.
  Access
    Brief:
      End hosts plug.
      Have high port count.
      Support many end hosts.
      Client security measures.
      LAN security measures.
  Distribution
    Brief:
      Aggregation point for access.
      Provide scalability.
      Software policy, such as QoS.
  Core
    Brief:
      Traffic travels through core.
      Speed and resiliency.

Spine-leaf data center design.
  Brief:
    East-West bound traffic.
    Good performance and scalability.
    Only 2 hops for servers to communicate with each other.
  Leaf layer
    Connected to servers.
