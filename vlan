VLAN
  Brief:
    Layer 2.
    VLAN on switches.
    Switches flood broadcast traffic raises performance and security concerns.
      Bypass security policy on router (blocking traffic between A and B).
      Affects performance by using bandwidth.
    Segment LAN into separate broadcast domains.
    1-1 relation between an IP subnet nad a VLAN.
    Traffics/hosts in same IP subnet should in same VLAN.
    Example: 

VLAN access port
  Brief:
    Configured on switch interfaces where end hosts are plugged in.
    One specific VLAN.
    All ports are VLAN 1 - default
  Commands:
    Create VLAN:
      vlan 10
      name Eng
    Configure switch ports as access port:
      interface FastEthernet0/1
      switchport mode access
      switch port access vlan 10
      ---
      interface range FastEthernet0/3 - 5
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan 10
    Basic:
      show vlan brief
      show interface fastEthernet0/1 switchport

VLAN Trunk Ports
  Brief:
    Dot1Q protocol.
    Link between switches as trunk port.
    Carry traffic for all VLANs.
    VLAN info in layer 2 header.
    Rmv Dot1Q VLAN when to end host.
    Format example - 802.1Q header (VLAN ID)
    Switch will detect that its IP phone.
  Native VLAN
    No end hosts.
    Inactive - no access port.
  Limiting allowed VLANS
    Security and performance.
  Best:
    Change to unused VLAN.
    Use 'switchport mode trunk' with another switch.
    Use 'switchport mode access' with end hosts.
    Manually config trunk ports.
  Commands:
    Basic:
      show interface gig0/1 switchport
    Configure interface as trunk port.
      interface fastEthernet0/24
      description Trunk to SW2
      switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
      switchport mode trunk
    Special config IP phone with a PC
      interface FastEthernet 0/10
      description IP Phone
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan 10
      switchport voice vlan 20
    Native VLAN configuration
      vlan 199
      name Native
      interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
      description Trunk to SW2
      switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
      switchport mode trunk
      switchport trunk native vlan 199
    Allowed VLAN config
      interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
      switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,30

DTP Dynamic trunking protocol
  Brief:
    Not recommended.
  Commands:
    Form trunk if neighbour switch port is trunk:
      switchport mode dynamic auto
    Form trunk:
      switchport mode dynamic desirable
    Disables DTP:
      switchport nonegotiate

VTP VLAN trunking protocol
  Brief:
    Add new switch with no VLANs will delete all existing VLANs.
  VTP server:
    Add, edit, delete VLANs on switches.
    Changes on VTP server synchronize all switches.
    VTP server synchronize VLAN db from another server with higher revision number.
  VTP client:
    Switches VTP clients synchronize VLAN db with switch VTP servers.
  VTP transparent:
    Middleman, pass info from server to client.
  Commands:
    Configuration:
      vtp domain flackbox
      vtp mode server/client/transparent
    Add VLAN:
      vlan 20
      name sales
    Verification:
      show vtp status

Network Topology
  Brief:
    Access, distribution, and core layers.
    Traditional data center env - North-South traffic flow.
    Modern - West-East.
  Access
    Brief:
      End hosts plug.
      Have high port count.
      Support many end hosts.
      Client security measures.
      LAN security measures.
  Distribution
    Brief:
      Aggregation point for access.
      Provide scalability.
      Software policy, such as QoS.
  Core
    Brief:
      Traffic travels through core.
      Speed and resiliency.

Spine-leaf data center design.
  Brief:
    East-West bound traffic.
    Good performance and scalability.
    Only 2 hops for servers to communicate with each other.
  Leaf layer
    Connected to servers.
