Etherchannel
  Brief:
    Group multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface.
    Spanning-tree will not block any ports.
    Load balance across all links in etherchannel.
    Redundancy.
    LACP, PaGP, and static protocols.
    Matching settings.
  LACP Link aggregation control protocol
    Brief:
      Open standard.
      Active or passive.
    Commands:
      Verify:
        show etherchannel summary
        show spanning-tree vlan 1
      Create interface portchannel:
        int range f0/23 - 24
        channel-group 1 mode active
      Configure interface portchannel:
        interface port-channel 1
        switchport mode trunk
      PAgP configuration:
        channel-group 1 mode desirable
      Static configuration:
        channel-group 1 mode on

Oversubscription
  Brief:  
    Aggregation capacity greater than actual demand from end hosts.
    Aggregation capacity of network resourcecs,
      such as ports, bandwidth, or processing power.
    Not all devices will use the max capacity simultaneously.
    20:1 access to dist layer.
      20 PCs with 1 Gbps each require a 1G uplink to dist layer.
    4:1 dist to core layer.

Mutlti-chassis Etherchannel
  Brief:
    Multiple physical chassis are interconnected to single logical entity.
    Link aggregation of physical links between multiple switches/routers 
      to create single logical link.
    Full use of physical bandwidth across all interfaces.
    Increase capacity, redundancy, and load balancing.
    Failover to another interface.
    Forming loop-free topology.
    Must match settings.
    StackWise, VSS, and vPC.

Layer 3 Etherchannel
  Brief:
  Commands:
    Notes:
      Simalar to layer 2.
      But 'no switchport' command, standard layer 3 command.
    Configuration:
      interface port-channel 1
      ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.252
      no shutdown

Layer 3 links everywhere
  Brief:
    No spanning-tree anymore.
    Support routing protocol, 
      efficient routing table management and dynamic updates.
    Routing protocol to handle path determination.
    Equal cost load balancing.
    Access layer switches will be the default gateway.
