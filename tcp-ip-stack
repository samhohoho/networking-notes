TCP/IP stack
  - A protocol stack consists of multiple protocols including TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol)
  - Used to transfer data in todays production networks.
  - To allow communication over large distances.
  - TCP IP layers similar to OSI layers.
  - Layers:
    - Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access
  - Exchanging PDU (Protocol Data Units) or Packets between 2 hosts.
    Meaning the entire stack

TCP
  - Header composed of:
    - src port, dst port, seq number, ack number, checksum
  - connection oriented
  - bidirectionally
  - sequencing to ensure segments in correct order
  - flow control
  - acknowledgement and retransmission
    - receiver sends acknowledgement if successful
    - sender resends if no acknowledgement
  - FTP (file transfer protocol)(port 21), SSH (secure shell)(22), Telnet (23), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)

The TCP Three-Way Handshake
  - sender initiate SYN (Synchronized Message)
  - receiver then reply with SYN-ACK (Synchronized Acknowledgement)
  - sender sends ACK

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
  - not connection oriented
  - no Handshake connection
  - no sequencing, acknowledgement, flow control
  - not reliable
  - no error detection and recovery, only provided by upper layers
  - TFTP (69), SNMP (simple network management protocol)(161)

TCP and UDP
  - DNS (53)

UDP vs TCP
  - TCP -> reliability
    very slow for video due to extra overhead
  - UDP -> real time app (video or voice)

IP (Internet Protocol)
  - layer 3 protocol
  - connectionless protocol, no acknowledgement

IP Header
  - a component of the IP added to the beginning of data packet.
  - provide addressing, routing, and control info for data transmission.
  - includes:
    - version: IPv4 or IPv6
    - Header length
    - differentiated service (DSCP): QoS
    - explicit congestion notification: transmission rate adjustment
    - total length: header & data payload
    - identification, flags, fragmentation offset: fragmentation, reassembly, & order.
    - time to live (TTL): max number of network hops (routers) a packet can transverse.
    - protocol: specifies protocol to help receiver's interpretion.
    - header checksum: to detect error/corruption by verifying the header integrity.
    - source and destination IP address: sender and recipient.

IP Addressing
  - principal communication protocol
  - partition network into subnets.
    improve performance & security
