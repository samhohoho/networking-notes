DHCP snooping - 1st security mechanism
  Brief:
    Configures switch ports as trusted or untrusted.
    Mitigate risks associated with rogue DHCP servers and unauthorized network device.
    Ports connected to DHCP servers are trusted.
    User-facing ports are untrusted.
  Commands:
    ip dhcp snooping
    ip dhcp snooping vlan 10
    int f0/1
    ip dhcp snooping trust

DAI Dynamic ARP Inspection - 2nd
  Glossary:
    Gratuitous ARP - not actual ARP update
  Brief:
    Require DHCP spoofing be enabled.
    Inspect ARP message and maintain ARP table.
    Validate ARP request before forwarding.
  MITM Man-in-the-middle ARP spoofing / ARP poisoning
    Brief:
      Intercept and manipulate network traffic between 2 communicating parties.
      Exploits vulnerabilities in ARP.
      Attacker sends forged ARP responses.
      Attacker sends gratuitous ARP.
      Claims attacker's MAC address is associated with targeted device's IP address.
      Poison ARP cache.
  Commands:
    int f0/1
    ip arp inspection trust
    ip arp inspection vlan 10

802.1x Identity based networking - 3rd
  Brief:
    Networking standard.
    Provides port-based access control for wired and wireless network.
    Enhance security by authenticating and authorizing devices
      before granting access.
    Authenticator, authentication request, supplicant, authentication server
    Transitions network port/access point to 'authorized' state.
    
Port security
  Brief:
    Prevents wireless access points or shared devices.
    MAC address filtering.
    Security violation options,
      shutdown (default), protect, restrict.
  To recover error-disabled interface:
    Remove the unauthorized MAC address.
    'shutdown' then 'no shutdown' on interface.
  MAC address learning:
    Add learned MAC address to run-config.
    Save it to start-config for permanent.
  Commands:
    Verify:
      show post-security interface f0/2
      show post-security
      ping
    Default setting:
      int f0/2
      switchport post-security - only 1 MAC address allowed, no save.
      ---
      switchport post-security maximum 2
    Violation action configuration
      int f0/2
      switchport port-security violation protect | restrict
    Auto-recovery
      errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation
      errdisable recovery interval 600 - 600 seconds
    MAC address filtering
      interface fa0/10
      switchport port-security
      switchport port-security mac address 1111.2222.3333
      switchport port-security maximum 1
    MAC address learning
      interface fa0/2
      switchport port-security
      switchport port-security mac-address sticky
