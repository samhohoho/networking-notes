DNS hijacking / DNS redirection / DNS poisoning

Where an attacker intercepts and modifies DNS queries or responses to redirect users to unauthorized or malicious websites.
Other purposes:
  Phishing attacks
    - To redirect users to fake websites that imitate legitimate platforms.
  Malware distribution
    - To redirect users to websites hosting malware or exploit kits, which can lead to unauthorized access, and data theft.
  Advertising fraud
    - To redirect users and display fraudulent ads.
    - It is known as INJECTION, allowing attackers to generate revenue through ads clicks.
  Censorship and surveillance
    - To block access to specific websites or redirect users to alternative websites under their control.
  Data theft
    - By redirection DNS queries, attackers can route user traffic through their servers and capture the transmitted data.

Cache poisoning / DNS spoofing

To manipulate the data stored in a DNS resolver's cache to redirect users to malicious websites or intercept their communicatios.
Process:
  DNS resolution process.
    - The DNS resolver performs a DNS lookup to obtain the IP address associated with that domain when a user submits a domain name.
  DNS caching.
    - The DNS resolver stores the results of the previous DNS lookups in their cache for a certain period.
  Cache poisoning
    - An attacker sends forged DNS responses to a DNS resolver, pretending to be a legitimate DNS server.
