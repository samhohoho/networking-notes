Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/

To disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service of network by overwhelming the target/surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic.
To prevent regular traffic from arriving at its destination.
It utilizes multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.
Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources suck as IoT devices.

How does the attack work?
  - using the networks of internet-connected machines, which have been infected with malware, allowing them to be controlled remotely by an attacker.
  - These devices are known as bots, or botnet for a group of bots.
  - Attacker sends bots the remote instructions to direct an attack.
  - Each bot sends requests to the target's IP address, causing the server/network to become overwhelmed, resulting in a denial-of-service to normal traffic.

How to identify the attack?
  - when a site becomes slow or unavailable.
  - use traffic analytic tools.
  - suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range.
  - a flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile (device type, geolocation, or web browser version)
  - an unexplained surge in requests to a single endpoint.
  - odd traffic patterns (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes).

OSI model
https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/
How network connection is made.
How computer networking protocols should work with each other.
Network connection on the internet is composed of different components/layers.
  - Application:
    human-computer interaction layer, where apps can access the network services.
  - Presentation:
    ensure that data is in a usable format.
    data encryption.
  - Session:
    maintain connection.
    Control ports and sessions.
  - Transport:
    Transmit data using transmission protocols
    including TCP and UDP.
  - Network:
    Decides which physical path the data will take.
  - Data Link:
    Defines the format of data on the network.
  - Physical:
    Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium.

Application layer attacks
To exhaust the target's resources to create a denial-of-service.
It targets the layer where web pages are generated on the server.
Hard to differentiate malicious traffic from legitimate page.
A single HTTP req is cheap on client side, but its expensive for the server, as it loads multiple files and run db queries.
HTTP flood:
  - large numbers of HTTP requests flood the server, resulting in denial-of-service.
  - using attacking IP addresses, referrers and user agents.
